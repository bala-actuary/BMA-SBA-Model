# BMA SBA Assessment Model Project

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the foundational research, analysis, and planning documents for a project to build a comprehensive model for the Bermuda Monetary Authority's (BMA) Scenario-Based Approach (SBA). The project's goal is to create a robust and flexible tool for the BMA to assess the soundness of insurance groups' SBA implementations.

The analysis of the BMA's regulations has been completed, and the project is now in the planning phase for software development.
