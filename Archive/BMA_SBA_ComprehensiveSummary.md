# Comprehensive Summary of the Bermudian Monetary Authority's (BMA) Scenario-Based Approach (SBA)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview and Purpose of the SBA

The Scenario-Based Approach (SBA) is an alternative method for insurance groups to calculate their Best Estimate Liabilities (BEL) for long-term business. It is designed to be a more risk-sensitive and principles-based approach compared to the standard formula. The primary objective of the SBA is to allow insurance groups with well-matched asset and liability portfolios to better reflect their specific risk profile in their solvency calculations.

The SBA is intended to provide a more accurate and economic-based valuation of an insurer's liabilities by projecting asset and liability cash flows under a variety of prescribed and entity-specific scenarios. This approach is particularly relevant for businesses with long-term liabilities and predictable cash flows.

*(Handbook: E1.1, E4.1)*

### 1.2. Scope and Applicability

The SBA is applicable to long-term insurance business. Insurance groups can elect to use the SBA for some or all of their long-term business, subject to meeting the BMA's eligibility criteria and obtaining prior written approval. The BMA also has the discretion to require a group to use the SBA.

To be eligible for the SBA, an insurance group must demonstrate that its asset and liability portfolios are "well-matched". This means that the cash flows from the asset portfolio are matched to the liability cash flows in terms of timing and amount, under a range of different scenarios.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(1), 28(2), 28(3); Handbook: E1.1, E4.1)*

## 2. Core Principles and Framework

### 2.1. Well-Matched Portfolios

A central requirement for using the SBA is that the insurance group's asset and liability portfolios are well-matched. The group must perform and document a formal assessment of this, including its definition of "well-matched" and the thresholds, tolerances, and triggers that would cause the group to consider its portfolio not well-matched.

The BMA assesses the "well-matched" nature of the portfolio by considering factors such as:
- The cost of mismatch between the base and biting scenarios.
- The dispersion in results from the prescribed scenarios.
- The extent to which assets and liabilities are denominated in the same currencies.
- The extent of asset sales to meet shortfalls in asset cash flows.
- The extent of and dependence on reinvestment.

*(Handbook: E4.1, E4.3a-i)*

### 2.2. Market-Consistent Valuation

The SBA is based on market-consistent valuation principles. Assets and liabilities are valued on an economic, fair-value basis. The valuation of assets and liabilities must be consistent with the Economic Balance Sheet (EBS) valuation principles as set out in Schedule XXV of the Rules.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(1); Handbook: E5.6g)*

## 3. Scenario Design and Application

### 3.1. Prescribed Scenarios

The SBA requires insurance groups to run their calculations through a set of nine prescribed interest rate scenarios. These scenarios are designed to test the resilience of the group's balance sheet to a variety of interest rate movements.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(7))*

#### 3.1.1. Interest Rate Scenarios

The nine prescribed interest rate scenarios are:
1.  **Base Scenario:** No adjustment to the rates.
2.  **Decrease Scenario:** All rates decrease annually to a total decrease of 1.5% in the tenth year, and are unchanged thereafter.
3.  **Increase Scenario:** All rates increase annually to a total increase of 1.5% in the tenth year, and are unchanged thereafter.
4.  **Down-Up Scenario:** All rates decrease annually to a total decrease of 1.5% in the fifth year, then revert to the base scenario level by the tenth year.
5.  **Up-Down Scenario:** All rates increase annually to a total increase of 1.5% in the fifth year, then revert to the base scenario level by the tenth year.
6.  **Decrease with Positive Twist:** A scenario with a positive twist to the yield curve.
7.  **Decrease with Negative Twist:** A scenario with a negative twist to the yield curve.
8.  **Increase with Positive Twist:** A scenario with a positive twist to the yield curve.
9.  **Increase with Negative Twist:** A scenario with a negative twist to the yield curve.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(7) a-i)*

### 3.2. Other Required Stresses

In addition to the interest rate scenarios, the SBA requires the application of other stresses, including:
- **Credit Spread and Mass Lapse Stress:** A combined stress scenario involving a mass lapse event and widening of credit spreads.
- **One-Notch Credit Downgrade:** A one-notch downgrade to all assets across the board.

*(Handbook: E5.6h)*

## 4. Calculation of Best Estimate Liability (BEL)

The BEL under the SBA is determined as the highest asset requirement across all the prescribed scenarios. This is often referred to as the "biting scenario".

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(10)(c))*

### 4.1. Projection of Cash Flows

The SBA involves the projection of asset and liability cash flows over the lifetime of the business. These projections must be realistic and based on credible assumptions. The cash flows must be projected under each of the prescribed scenarios.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(9))*

### 4.2. Discounting and Risk-Free Rate

The projected cash flows are discounted to their present value using the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. The choice of the risk-free curve must be documented and used consistently. The spreads used must be consistent with the choice of the risk-free curve.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(7); Handbook: E9.1-E9.5)*

## 5. Asset and Liability Management (ALM) and Investment Strategy

### 5.1. Eligible Assets

The SBA defines specific categories of "acceptable assets" that can be used to back the liabilities. These are primarily high-quality, investment-grade assets with predictable cash flows. The use of other assets is possible on a limited basis with prior approval from the BMA.

Acceptable assets include:
- Government bonds
- Municipal bonds
- Public corporate bonds
- Cash and cash equivalents

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(13))*

The use of other investment-grade fixed-income assets, structured assets, and derivatives requires prior BMA approval.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(14); Handbook: E6, E7, E8)*

### 5.2. Reinvestment and Disinvestment Strategy

Insurance groups must have a clearly defined disinvestment strategy aligned with their investment policy. The model should reflect this strategy, and any sales of assets should be for the purpose of meeting excess liability cash flows.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(34))*

Reinvestment of excess cash flow should be in line with the current asset allocation and consistent with the group's ALM and investment policies.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(33))*

### 5.3. Treatment of Derivatives

Derivatives used in the SBA must qualify as being for risk-mitigating purposes and comply with the eligibility and modeling criteria set out in the handbook. Dynamic hedging (daily or intra-day) is not allowed in the SBA.

*(Handbook: E8)*

## 6. Governance and Risk Management

### 6.1. Board and Senior Management Oversight

The Board of Directors is responsible for approving the use of the SBA and any major changes to the model. There must be a clear governance structure for the SBA, including roles and responsibilities of the board, senior management, and control functions.

*(Rules: Paragraph 28(40)(a))*

### 6.2. Model Change Policy

Insurance groups using the SBA must have a model change policy that defines what constitutes a major or minor change to the model. Major changes require prior approval from the BMA.

*(Handbook: E3.1-E3.3; Rules: Paragraph 28(40)(e))*

### 6.3. Attestations and Reporting

The use of the SBA requires several attestations from key officers, including the approved actuary, chief risk officer, and chief investment officer. These attestations cover various aspects of the SBA, from the appropriateness of the model to the quality of the data used.

*(Handbook: E2.1-E2.6m)*

## 7. Application and Approval Process

### 7.1. Application Package

To use the SBA, an insurance group must submit a comprehensive application package to the BMA. This package must include:
- Evidence that the eligibility requirements are met.
- Sign-off from the Board.
- Completed Lapse, Liquidity, and SBA reporting templates.
- Full SBA model calculations.
- Assessment of the asset/liability portfolio being well-matched.
- Detailed SBA methodology documentation.
- Validation reports.
- Summary and analysis of stress testing results.
- Policies on model risk, data quality, model change, and ALM.

*(Handbook: E5.1-E5.11)*

### 7.2. BMA Review and Approval

The BMA will review the application package and may request additional information. The review timeframe is expected to be 4-8 weeks for complete and high-quality submissions. The approval is subject to the BMA's discretion.
